# Hubble

Wrapper around Nostrum Elixir Discord library to provide parsing and command handling automatically with central configuration file

## Usage

To use this library, add in your `config.exs` the prefix you wish to use for your Discord bot.

And also ensure that you are loading your Discord bot token in either `config.exs` or `runtime.exs` (if you are loading from an `.env` file)
